__Note__ : In order to run the Example VIs for the Design Patterns:

1. Open the project
2. Expand the Console Out foler and run the Console.vi
3. Open any example and run them to see their outputs on the console.


I did that because I took as a reference examples in Java and that was when I was learning the patterns. I swear I'll make it better as soon as I have time :smiley:
